#Vectorisert
("vectorized" in Norwegian)

##A machine learning app for drawing black metal band logos. 

Rather than using image recognition I'm planning on converting all of the training data images to svg. Then giving Vectorisert all of the coordinates and a label of what text the image contains. Usage will be supplying Vectorisert with a string of text and having it output coordinates for you. Those could just be pasted into an svg, but I may go further with it and actually make a little web interface that would actually show you the image right away.
