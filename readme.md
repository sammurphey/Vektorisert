Vectorisert
===========

("vectorized" in Norwegian)

A machine learning app for drawing black metal band logos.
----------------------------------------------------------

Rather than using image recognition I'm planning on converting all of the training data images to SVG. Then giving Vectorisert all the coordinates and a label of what text the image contains. You will use it by supplying Vectorisert with a string of text and it will output an array of generated coordinates for you. Those could just be pasted into an SVG, but I may go further with it and actually make a little web interface that would actually show you the image right away.
